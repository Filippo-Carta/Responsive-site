                    <p>I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and have a decent understanding of JavaScript. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the basic building block of web pages. It is used to structure content on the internet, such as paragraphs, headings, and images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style and layout the content on web pages, determining things like colors, fonts, and spacing.
                        <br><br>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. It can be used to create animations, handle user interactions, and dynamically update content on a webpage. While I am still learning JavaScript, I have a basic understanding of how it works and how to incorporate it into my projects.
                        <br><br>In addition to web development, I have also dabbled in Android app development. I have a basic understanding of Java, which is the primary programming language used for Android development. I have built a few simple apps, such as calculators and to-do lists, and have experimented with implementing various features, such as push notifications and database integration.
                        Overall, I am constantly learning and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Android app development. I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and delving deeper into these technologies to create more complex and polished projects in the future.</p>

                    - As you probably understand, I'm not from England or the USA, I'm from Italy, so I'm not as good at speaking as you may think. <br><br>
                    - Well, if you speak English, I would advise you to communicate with me through chat instead of speaking, due to my slightly incorrect pronunciation. <br><br>
                    - Even if you are Italian like me, I would prefer not to speak often with a microphone, but if necessary I will do so without any problems. <br><br>
                    - I'm not on the computer that often, so I may not respond within 24 hours, but I will definitely respond within 48 hours <br><br>

                    Since I know the python language, I could implement it in the work of a Data Analyst, even though I currently have no experience. <br><br>
                    I think that one day I will be able to do this even without too many problems. If someone is looking for a Data-Analyst, let me know. <br>
